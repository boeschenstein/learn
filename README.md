### Effects

- Demotivation
- Feeling stupid
- Comparison
- Abandoning Plans
- Wasting Time

### Education is a process

- Many Steps
- Content today provides only 1 step
- You have to do the rest

### Existing Content is passive

- Retention is KEY
- Motivation
- Passive vs. Active
  - Passive: 5% - 7%
  - Active: 75% - 90%
  - Teaching: 90% - 100%
- Typing is NOT coding

- passive examples
  - videos
  - blog
  - talks

### A natual Example:  Learning to ride a bike

- Modeling correct behavior
- Tutored introduction
- Gradual release of responsibility
- Reflection
- Repetition
- No viewing of video's involved

### Generation = Active learning

When you are asked to generate an answer to a question. Apply in a new scenario.

- 2 + 2 = 4
- 2 + 3 = 5
- 2 + 4 = ?

### The Role of Teachers

- Coaches/Tutor value
- Teach
- Assign proper exercises
